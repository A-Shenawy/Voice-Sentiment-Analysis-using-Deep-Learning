🚀 Voice Sentiment Analysis Using Deep Learning

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to classify emotions from voice recordings using deep learning techniques. Human speech carries rich emotional cues, and analyzing these can enhance human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and customer experience analysis. The model is trained on the EYASE dataset, which contains Arabic voice samples labeled with emotions: happy, sad, angry, and neutral.

🎯 Objectives
Develop a CNN-based deep learning model to classify emotions from speech.
Preprocess and augment voice data to improve model generalization.
Extract Mel-Spectrogram features for deep learning-based classification.
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall.

📊 Dataset Details
Total audio files: 579
Sentiment classes:
Happy: 132
Sad: 147
Angry: 150
Neutral: 150
Average sample rate: 44.1 KHz
Average audio duration: 2.33 sec
Data augmentation techniques applied: Noise addition, pitch shifting
Final dataset after augmentation: 1,626 audio samples

🛠️ Methodology

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing & Augmentation
Padding & truncating: Standardizing audio length.
Data augmentation:
Noise addition → Simulates real-world background noise.
Pitch shifting → Enhances model robustness to voice variations.
2️⃣ Feature Extraction
Mel-Spectrogram transformation: Converts raw audio into spectrogram images.
Normalization & down-sampling: Reducing sample rate for efficient processing.
3️⃣ Model Architecture (CNN-Based Approach)
Input: Mel-Spectrogram images.
Convolutional Layers (Conv2D) → Extracts spatial features.
MaxPooling Layers → Reduces dimensionality.
Dropout Layers → Prevents overfitting.
Flatten Layer → Converts 2D features to 1D.
Dense Layers → Classifies the emotions.
4️⃣ Training & Validation
Train-test split: 80% training, 20% testing.
Cross-validation: 5-Fold K-Fold validation to ensure robustness.

📈 Results & Performance

Initial Model Accuracy: 86.76%
Confusion Matrix Analysis:
High precision & recall for Angry and Sad classes.
Slight misclassification in Neutral vs. Happy classes.
K-Fold Cross-Validation Scores:
Average Accuracy: 87.7%
Average F1 Score: 87.63%
Average Recall: 87.7%
Average Precision: 87.92%

📌 Future Improvements

Optimize model architecture for better generalization.
Explore transformer-based models (e.g., Wav2Vec2, Whisper) for speech processing.
Integrate emotion detection with real-time applications (e.g., chatbots, virtual assistants).
